%define arraysize	30000

;; For the compiler, the text segment is also the data segment. The
;; memory image of the compiler is inside the code buffer, and is
;; modified in place to become the memory image of the compiled
;; program. The area of memory that is the data segment for compiled
;; programs is not used by the compiler. The text and data segments of
;; compiled programs are really only different areas in a single
;; segment, from the system's point of view. Both the compiler and
;; compiled programs load the entire file contents into a single
;; memory segment which is both writeable and executable.

;; Here begins the file image.

;; At the beginning of the text segment is the ELF header and the
;; program header table, the latter consisting of a single entry. The
;; two structures overlap for a space of eight bytes. Nearly all
;; unused fields in the structures are used to hold bits of code.

;; The beginning of the ELF header.

;; The top(s) of the main compiling loop. The loop jumps back to
;; different positions, depending on how many bytes to copy into the

;; epilog code chunk, a copy of edi (the pointer to the end of the
;; code buffer) is saved in ebp, the high bytes of eax are reset to
;; zero (via the exchange with ebx), and then the next character of
;; input is retrieved.

;; The bracket routine emits code for the "[" instruction. This

;; This is where the size of the executable file is stored in the

;; this field is also used as an input buffer.)

filesize:	dd	compilersize		; phdr.p_filesz

;; The size of the program in memory. This entry creates an area of
;; bytes, arraysize in size, all initialized to zero, starting at
;; DATAORG.

		dd	DATAOFFSET + arraysize	; phdr.p_memsz

;; The code chunk for the "." instruction. eax is set to 4 to invoke

;; the first byte of the first instruction, which is also the least
;; significant byte of the p_flags field, encodes to 0xB3. Having the
;; 2-bit set marks the memory containing the compiler, and its
;; compiled programs, as writeable.)

;; The main loop of the compiler continues here, by obtaining the next

;; instruction. eax is set to 3 to invoke the read system call. ebx,
;; the file handle to read from, is set to 0 for stdin. ecx points to

;; location of the missing target in the code for the "[" instruction
;; is then retrieved from the stack, the correct target value is
